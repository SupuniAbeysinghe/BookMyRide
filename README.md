# BookMyRide
A traditional web application designed for vehicle service reservations, with a strong emphasis on security, authentication, and access control. 
This application specifically addresses security vulnerabilities identified in the OWASP Top 10, particularly focusing on mitigating Broken Access Control, SQL Injection, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
User authentication and access control are implemented using OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocols, with Asgardeo serving as the cloud-based Identity Provider (IDP) for seamless authentication management.
